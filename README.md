# Gender Pay Gap Analysis

## Overview
This project presents a visual analysis of the gender pay gap across different periods, career stages, and occupations. The graphs highlight both the historical shifts in the gender pay gap and the differences in wages between male- and female-dominated occupations.

## Graphs and Analysis

 **Gender Pay Gap Over Time (1981-2013)**  
   This graph illustrates the historical changes in the gender pay gap over the period from 1981 to 2013. It shows how the gap between male and female salaries has fluctuated, with notable periods of improvement and plateaus. The most significant reduction in the gap occurred between 2009 and 2011, but disparities still remain.

 **Average Wage by Age Bracket and Gender**  
   This graph breaks down the gender pay gap by age group, showing how the disparity grows as individuals age. It reveals that women earn progressively less compared to men as they advance in their careers, particularly in the 40-50 and 50+ age brackets.

 **Average Wage by Occupation (Top Occupations for Women)**  
   This graph focuses on the average wages for women in occupations where they are overrepresented, such as nursing, teaching, and secretarial roles. It shows that women are often concentrated in lower-paying jobs, despite the importance of many of these roles.

 **Average Wage by Occupation (Top Occupations for Men)**  
   This graph presents the average wages for men in male-dominated occupations like management, construction, and sales. It demonstrates that men tend to dominate higher-paying roles, contributing to the overall wage disparity.
